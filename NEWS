Development version
    * "pax" or "cp" will be used to copy the skeleton directory, rather
      than "tar" or "cp".
    * "make check" now now runs shellcheck (https://www.shellcheck.net/)
      on the shell script, and "mandoc -T lint" on the manuals.
      The tests are skipped if the needed tools are not found by
      "configure".
    * Several simplifications and cosmetic changes to the code.
    * When using "-d", require that the given directory exists.

Release 20180719
    * A skeleton directory (to pre-populate the temporary working
      directory with) may be specified by setting the SHELL_SKEL
      environment variable to the path of a directory.  This environment
      variable is not used if the command line option -s or -d is used.
    * /bin/sh is used if SHELL is empty or unset and no other shell is
      specified.

Release 20180422
    * Added NEWS file.
    * Added -q option for quiet operation.
    * Added -v option to output version information.
    * Added USR1 signal handler that will stop the temporary directory
      from being deleted when the shell exits (as if -k had been used from
      the start).
    * Let the configure script figure out whether "mktemp -t" adds
      ".XXXXXXXX" to the end of the given template or not.
    * Don't choke on directories whose name start with a dash.
    * Now properly tested on FreeBSD 11.1.

Release 20180415
    * Fixed GitHub issue #1, "Centos 7 several shells with the same name".
    * Fixed GitHub issue #2, "Comparison null string to zero (int)"
    * Added manual.
    * Added -f option to force running the given command (bypasses check
      for valid login shell).
    * Added -s option for specifying a "skeleton" directory whose
      contents will be (recursively) copied into the newly created
      temporary directory.
    * Updated static list of shells on Solaris with shells from the
      shells(4) manual on a Solaris 11.4-beta system.
    * Set HOME to the temporary directory.

Release 20180401
    * First real release.
