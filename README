* shell:

    Creates a shell for testing things in.

    This script is useful for testing things in an interactive
    environment other than your usual shell, or for testing things in a
    clean environment with automatic cleanup of any files left behind.

    Creates a "temporary interactive shell" with a temporary working
    directory (unless the "-d" flag is used to specify an existing
    directory) and clean environment.  The working directory is removed
    when the shell exits (unless the "-k" or "-d" flag was used).

    The temporary working directory may also be pre-populated with the
    contents of an existing directory (using the "-s" flag).

    See "man 1 shell" after installation.
