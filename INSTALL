This project uses GNU autotools.

To install the scripts under "/usr/local" (scripts will always go in the
"bin" subdirectory):

    ./configure
    make
    make install

Then make sure that "/usr/local/bin" is in your "$PATH".

To install under "$HOME/local":

    ./configure --prefix="$HOME/local"
    make
    make install

To install using GNU Stow under "$HOME/local":

    ./configure --prefix="$HOME/local/stow/shell-toolbox"
    make
    make install
    cd "$HOME/local/stow"
    stow shell-toolbox

Then make sure that "$HOME/local/bin" is in your "$PATH".


Caveat: If you run "make distclean", the generated manuals, which are
part of the distribution sources, will be removed.  These won't be
rebuilt unless you have mandoc(1) installed.
