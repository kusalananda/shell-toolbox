This project uses GNU autotools.

To install the scripts under "/usr/local" (scripts will always go in the
"bin" subdirectory):

    ./configure
    make
    make install

Then make sure that "/usr/local/bin" is in your "$PATH".

To install under "$HOME/local":

    ./configure --prefix="$HOME/local"
    make
    make install

To install using GNU Stow under "$HOME/local":

    ./configure --prefix="$HOME/local/stow/shell-toolbox"
    make
    make install
    cd "$HOME/local/stow"
    stow shell-toolbox

Then make sure that "$HOME/local/bin" is in your "$PATH".

The following files will be installed unless the default installation
paths are modified:

    <prefix>
    |-- bin
    |   `-- shell
    `-- share
        |-- doc
        |   `-- shell-toolbox
        |       |-- LICENSE
        |       |-- NEWS
        |       |-- README
        |       |-- shell.md
        |       `-- shell.txt
        `-- man
            `-- man1
                `-- shell.1


Caveat: If you run "make distclean", the generated manuals, which are
part of the distribution sources, will be removed.  These won't be
rebuilt unless you have mandoc(1) installed.

Using the tools without access to "make":

After running the configure script, the generated Makefiles are actually
just (currently) used for installing the various files in the correct
locations.  If you are on a system where "make" is not available (due to
arbitrary decisions/omissions by the system administrators), then you
may just copy the generated scripts from the "src" folder (and possibly
the manuals from "doc") to wherever you want to keep them.

Note that the tools have not been thoroughly tested to work this way.
